## The PTEROSOR project


Catalys and solar cell technologies are underpinned by a fundamental process:
that of exciting systems to a higher energy level than the groundstate.
Defining an effective method to achieve this that also provides accurate
energies of the excited states is often a challenge. The EU-funded PTEROSOR
project will tackle this fundamental problem using mathematical techniques. The
researchers'novel approach for measuring the energies of excited states and
dening wave functions in molecular systems will hinge on the use of a general
class of Hamiltonians with parity-time(PT) symmetry. The gateway between ground
and excited states will be provided by exceptional points which lie at the
boundary between broken and unbroken PT-symmetric regions.
